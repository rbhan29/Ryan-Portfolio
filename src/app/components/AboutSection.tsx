              I&#39;m a design technologist with a growing passion for crafting thoughtful digital experiences that connect people and technology in meaningful ways. Currently exploring the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), I&#39;m actively learning how users interact with digital systems and how to design interfaces that feel intuitive, accessible, and engaging.
            </p>
            <p>
              My practice blends interaction design principles with front-end development, allowing me to experiment with creating user interfaces that are not only functional but also enjoyable to use. I&#39;m especially interested in how small design decisions can shape the overall experience and impact of a product.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I continue to build my skills in UI and UX design, I&#39;m always curious, always learning, and always striving to create experiences that feel human-centered and purposeful.
